Shopping cart using java bean and EL:

To display the xml data we use JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library).
I used the followinng resource:
JSP - XML Data: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/jsp_xml_data.htm 
As it is described we have to download two jar files and copy them into your <Tomcat Installation Directory>\lib, but it's better for our purpose to copy them in the project folder WEB_INF/lib/.
Also only these two jar files are not enough and we need to add also the file batik-ext-1.7.jar, which we can dowload from here:
http://www.jarfinder.com/index.php/jars/versionInfo/16905 
or directly from 
http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/org/apache/xmlgraphics/batik-ext/1.7/batik-ext-1.7.jar
With these tree jar files our project is working already.

For cookies we use the tag library described in the following tutorial:
Cookie taglib ver. 2.0: http://www.servletsuite.com/servlets/cooktag.htm
We have to put in our project the jar file and the tld file, which we can also download from that page.

We use the following java classes:
1)class Item
- properties: price, quantity
- methods: getPrice, setPrice, getQuantity, setQuantity, calculateItemTotal
2)class Cart
- properties: items (array list from Item objects)
- methods: getItems, setItems, isCartCreated, createItems, getItem, calculateAllItemsTotal

To use these classes with script-free jsp pages:
Call JavaBean methods from JSP 2.0 pages: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2003/jw-0523-calltag.html?page=2 (pages 2 and 3)
